## What?
imgur-mirror-bot is a simple little bot that scans new reddit
submissions for image links, and provides a mirror to those
images as a comment in the original post.

## Why?
1. **Redundancy** - Traffic gained from getting featured on
reddit is often enough to bring a website to its knees. imgur-mirror-bot
makes sure you never miss out on that picture of the cute cat with
a tortilla on its head.

2. **Choice** - A lot of redditors do their redditing from their jobs or schools - 
these will often block common image hosts, websites like facebook or
tumblr (from which images are commonly linked), etc. imgur-mirror-bot
provides an alternative to these users.

## Isn't this against the rules?
No, imgur-mirror-bot uses the Reddit open API, and abides by its rules - all operations
have a delay between 3 and 6 seconds - I'd hate to be responsible for more downtime.

You can learn more about the reddit API [here](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/API)

The bot only runs on major subreddits with frequent image submissions, or where requested
by moderators & users.

## FAQ

**Q.** - Your "Upload Page" and "Direct Link" links both point to the same thing.  

**A.** - If you have RES (Reddit Enhancement Suite) enabled with the inline image viewer, it
will intelligently transform imgur.com page links to direct image links.
